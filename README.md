# Audio-gpt-web-app

In this project, you will build a bot using Node.js which interacts with users through a web application, interprets voice input from users, and responds verbally using GPT. The bot will convert the voice input from the web application into text, process the text using GPT, convert the GPT response back into spoken word, and feed the response back through the web application. The end goal is to enable users to communicate with GPT over a web interface using their voice. 

Requirements: 

1. Build a bot using Node.js which accepts and processes voice input from a web application. 

2. Implement a voice-based user interface on the web application where users can speak their queries. 

3. Implement speech-to-text functionality which converts the voice input from the web application into text. 

4. The bot should recognize the silence after the user stops speaking as a trigger to start processing the voice input. 

5. Pass the converted text into GPT. 

6. Implement text-to-speech functionality which converts the GPT response into speech, and returns this audio response to the user through the web application once the input has been processed. 

7. Deploy your solution on a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub pages. The web application should include a voice input mechanism for user queries and an audio player for the GPT-generated spoken replies.
